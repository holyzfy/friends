# The Blackout

- Could we talk about this later?
- I have no idea what you just said.
- Put Joey on the Phone.
    
    叫Joey接电话

- I don't think that's going to be you.

    我想你不是那种人

- It's never gonna happen.
- With all the lights out you can actually see the stars.

    所有的灯都灭了，你才可以真正的看到星星啊。

- This is so nice.
- We just found this cat and we're looking for the owener.
- The cat turned out to be Paolo's cat.
- I looked all over the building and I could't find the kitty anywhere.
- What did he say that was so funny?

    他讲什么这么好笑？

- Well, this has been fun.

    玩得真开心.
