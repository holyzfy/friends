# 05 The East Genman Laundry Detergent

- Would you let it go? It's not that big deal.
    
    别再争好吗？这又没什么大不了的。

- If I can actually do my own laundry. there isn't anything I can't do.
- How do you do that?
- It's like a gift. 

    gift: a natural ablity

- You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
- The woman thinks it over and then walks away.
    
    think something over: to consider something carefully, especially before reaching a decision.

- Did you see that?
- Thank you. Thank you. I could not have done this without you.
- We ripped the couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves.
