# 8 Nana Dies Twice

- It's Paolo calling from Rome.

    Paolo从罗马打来的电话。

- How are you doing?
- How is she doing?
- How we doing, you guys ready?

    各位如何？准备好没？

- How do you feel?
- What's with you hair?
    
    你的头发怎么了？

- What's different?
- Do you think thing would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
- Now I'm depressed! Even more than I was.

    真叫人难过，比刚才还难过。
